## Hacking, Changing or Using Gizmo Locally
See the <a href="https://github.com/ellder054/gizmolang/install">download</a> page to download Gizmo.  
In your command line, put the .zip file in usr/local/bin.  
To confirm that you have succesfully installed Gizmo, run the following code.
```shell
gizmo version
```

You can now use the `gizmo` command to compile gizmo programs!  
This is the format of the `gizmo` command.  
`gizmo <input-file> <output-file>`
