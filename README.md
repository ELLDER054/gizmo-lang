# The Gizmo Programming Language
Gizmo is a fast and strongly typed language, and sometimes those types of languages are a bit more intimidating than languages like Python or JavaScript. This is why the main priority of Gizmo is to be approachable and easy to write in.

Take this example:

```rust
string greet(string name) {
    write("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("World");
```
