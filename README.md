## Building Gizmo From Source
Warning: If you build Gizmo now, there is a chance that Gizmo will be updated and you will not have the most recent version.  
1. Make sure git is installed in your terminal.  
2. Run this code in your terminal to build Gizmo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ellder054/gizmo-lang
```

The Gizmo source will be put in the directory `gizmo-lang` and you can run Gizmo source code with the following.
```shell
cd gizmo-lang
./main.sh filename.gizmo
```
Replace `filename.gizmo` (on line 17) with whatever file you are trying to execute it on.  
  
To make sure you have the most recent version of Gizmo, run the following.
```shell
git pull https://github.com/ellder054/gizmo-lang
```
