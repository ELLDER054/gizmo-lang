# The Gizmo Programming Language
Gizmo is a small language designed not only to be fast and strongly typed, but also to give the programming more ease when writing code.

An example:

```
string hello(string name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
write(hello("World"));
```

This would output "Hello, World!".
