**Gizmo** is a fast and user friendly programming language for parsing and manipulating strings.  
Gizmo code looks like this:  
```
class Bird() {
  none init() {
    string this.state = "";
  }
  
  none flyTo(string state) {
    this.state = state;
    write("Flying to " + state);
  }
}
Bird bird = Bird();
bird.flyTo("Virginia");
write(bird.state) \ Virginia
bird.flyTo("Oregon");
write(bird.state) \ Oregon
```
