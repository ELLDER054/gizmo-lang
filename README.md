## Hacking, Changing or Using Gizmo Locally
Warning: If you clone Gizmo now, there is a chance that Gizmo will be updated and you will not have the most recent version.  
1. Make sure git is installed in your terminal.  
2. Run this code in your terminal to clone Gizmo.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ellder054/gizmo-lang
```

The Gizmo source will then be put in the directory `gizmo-lang`.

### Compiling a file
You can tell Gizmo to compile a Gizmo file with the following.
```shell
cd gizmo-lang
./main.sh filename.gizmo output
```
Replace `filename.gizmo` with whatever file you are trying to compile and replace `output` with your output file.  
  
To make sure you have the most recent version of Gizmo, run the following.
```shell
git pull https://github.com/ellder054/gizmo-lang
```
